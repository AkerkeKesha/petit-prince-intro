# petit-prince-intro

7 grade HTA students sample project. Students please read carefully the code and use any part of it for your current project. I would have paid attention to these details:

merging two scenes
if and else for scene changes
how to get the second scene
text label animation
text label a child of animated sprite. why?
how folders are sorted for this project
how audio files could be played
